# SecureDNS

## Synopsis

This is a Secure Domain Name Server project written in C++ for the engine and C# for the admin interface. The backend database is implemented using CDB package, which is written by Dan J. Bernstein 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This is unpaid project due to company bankruptcity. We dreamed to develop our own Secure DNS that can compete to the other products, sadly, there is no market for it in Africa.

## Installation

Project DNSServer can be compiled using CMake

cd DNSServer
cmake

Project BlockingPage is a PHP project that can be deployed on standard *Nix server to serve the blocking pages

Projects WedAdmin and ClientXXX are compile by Microsoft Visual Studio
